This project implements a 5-stage pipelined RV32I RISC-V processor in Verilog. It supports a subset of the base integer instruction set, including arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branch instructions. The design includes instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages, along with hazard detection and forwarding units to resolve data hazards. Key components in this core include an instruction memory, an adder, a sign extender, a control unit, an ALU, a register file, and data memory. This CPU is capable of executing RISC-V assembly programs and is verified through test benches using waveform analysis with tools like GTKWave.
